### 1. Description  
**What is this project?**  
* Creating a webpage from scratch, without source code, for use as my portfolio to showcase to potential employers the work I've done.  This project provides potential employers with samples of my work for them to assess if I'm a good candidate for an open position.  

**Why this project?**  
* To find employment it is essential to have a good portfolio of projects that demonstrates my capability as a developer.

**What problem does this project solve?**  
* Responsive website using the CSS flexbox property.

**Lessons learnt?**  
* This project helped me get my head around how to manage 'flexbox' when setting up my website. The true strength of flexbox is doing a number of sub-flexboxes to achieve your desired layout.
* A wireframe was started for this project however I used the homework brief example to structure my webpage.  In future, time permitting, I will make sure I have completed the wireframe exercise.
* I lost lots of time running into snags in this project.  I need to improve working faster initially and doing refinement once the webpage is roughed in. Currently I've found I get really distracted with my layout and then later I decide to drop another object in and then need to go back and re-layout.
* Discovered compatability issues that were not emulated on my browser's developer device emulator.  Something to watch out for.  Main issue is I discovered buttons are not working on iPhones.  I've swept my CSS with Autoprefixer to fix.

### 5. Credits  
I'm finding my number 1 resource for my CSS is the [W3 Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com).  The guys behind that project are awesome, they leave you with little excuse for not being able to resolve your own problems with their amazing online resource. No other credits for this work as all work has been completed without reference.

### 9. Tests  
- Opened on a Samsung Note 10+ and experienced full functionality and responsive behaviour was as expected.
- Opened on a Apple iPhone X - buttons not working or tooltips.  Swept my CSS with Autoprefixer but behaviour unchanged.  Did a web search and could not find any reasonable solutions, one site suggested moving buttons higher with z-index property but didn't try as it seems illogical and will interfere with the fixed navigation header.
- Ran the Google mobile friendly test and got the ok:
