### 1. Description  
**What is this project?**  
* Creating a webpage from scratch, without source code, for use as my portfolio to showcase to potential employers the work I've done.  This project provides potential employers with samples of my work for them to assess if I'm a good candidate for an open position.  

**Why this project?**  
* To find employment it is essential to have a good portfolio of projects that demonstrates my capability as a developer. 

**What problem does this project solve?**  
* Responsive website using the CSS flexbox property.

**Lessons learnt?**  
* This project helped me get my head around how to manage 'flexbox' when setting up my website. The true strength of flexbox is doing a number of sub-flexboxes to achieve your desired layout.
* A wireframe was started for this project however I used the homework brief example to structure my webpage.  In future, time permitting, I will make sure I have completed the wireframe exercise.
* I lost lots of time running into snags in this project.  I need to improve working faster initially and doing refinement once the webpage is roughed in. Currently I've found I get really distracted with my layout and then later I decide to drop another object in and then need to go back and re-layout.

I'm finding my number 1 resource for my CSS is the [W3 Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com).

No other credits for this work as all work has been completed without reference.
